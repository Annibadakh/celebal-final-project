# Shipment Management System

Shipment management system prototye.

## Purpose

To enable a private delivery service to collect and deliver parcels. The system lets a manager use a Management Dashboard to view, track, assign, and manage a list of all shipments. A separate, mobile-responsive user interface (the Courier To-Do Web Tool) allows bike couriers to track the shipments assigned to them and register a timestamp for pickup and delivery of the shipments, which is viewable to a manager from the Management Dashboard.
